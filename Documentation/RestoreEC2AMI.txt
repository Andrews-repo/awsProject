Note:
Originally I did this a different way that was slightly more involved.

aws ec2 describe-volumes --region us-east-1 --filters Name=attachment.instance-id,Values=i-0d119a36e365ad0f7 Name=attachment.delete-on-termination,Values=true
$ vol-0d62a7f862a28d376

aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-0d62a7f862a28d376 --description "This is my root volume snapshot"
$ snap-03a1f6a51fb29d57a
Note: It takes some time save the snapshot, run the following command to check in
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --snapshot-id snap-03a1f6a51fb29d57a

From here I was able to create a snapshot of my EC2 instance. I wasn't able
to figure out the right series of CLI inputs to convert the snapshot into a an AMI.
My guess is that you have to restore the snapshot to a volume and then create a new
EC2 Instance where you assign the volume ID. I think there is more to this though.
However, I was able to figure out how to convert the snapshot to an AMI through then
console online.
